# FonzMP

This repo hosts the code base for [fonzmp.com](https://fonzmp.com), my personal website. It will evolve over time.

This code base was generated primarily using AI and restructured to my liking with a few small tweaks.

The codebase uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which is a new framework in which I look to explore.
